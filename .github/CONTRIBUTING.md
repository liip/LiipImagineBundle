# Contributing

This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct][coc-md]. By participating in
this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Request Feature

If you believe a feature is missing, report it by [creating a new issue][issue-make] or
implement it by [submitting a pull request][pr-make].

*If you __request__ a new feature*, describe precisely what you would like implemented and
be sure to completely and accurately fill out the new issue template by providing the
*branch you would like the feature implemented on*, whether the feature *breaks backwards
compatibility*, and *any other requested details*. Moreover, including a detailed
description, links to external resources, and other references will provide guidance and
context for whomever ultimately implementations your request.

*If you __submit__ a new feature*, ensure you provide a verbose description of your
contribution, again making sure to completely fill out the new pull request template. Your
pull request must pass our [GitHub Actions automated build check][gh-actions], which runs our unit test
suite against various PHP versions and checks that proper code style standards are met.

## Report Bug

If you believe you have encountered a *behavioral bug*, *documentation error*, or *other
issue*, first search for an [existing issue][issue-list], and if one doesn't already exist,
then proceed to [create a new issue][issue-make]. If you have the available time and the
required skill set, we appreciate those who offer fixes themselves via
[pull requests][pr-list], as well.

Be sure to complete the new issue template by providing the *version of the bundle used*,
the *version of Symfony used*, and *any other requested information*. It is also helpful
to create a Symfony-standard fork reproducing the unexpected behavior; this provides those
trying to assist you with a working example of the bug. The more detail you provide the
more likely the issue will meet a beneficial resolution.

## Submit Your Changes

Whether you are creating a __bug fix__ or a __new feature__, the workflow for forking the
bundle, working on local changes, and finally requesting that your changes are merged back
into the upstream repository is the same.

1. __Fork/Clone/Branch Repository:__ 
   Fork the repository using the [GitHub][gh] web interface, clone your fork, and create a
   local `feature-` branch for new features or `bugfix-` branch for bug fixes.

   ```bash
   # after forking, clone your fork (replace <user> with your github username)
   git clone git@github.com:<user>/LiipImagineBundle.git

   # enter the newly cloned repository directory
   cd LiipImagineBunde

   # EITHER checkout a "feature-<name>" branch if creating a new feature
   git checkout -b feature-name-of-addition

   # OR checkout a "bugfix-<name>" branch if working on a bug fix
   git checkout -b bugfix-name-of-issue
   ```

2. __Install Dependencies:__ 
   Install the project's dependencies using [Composer][composer]. You *may* also install any
   of the optional dependencies defined in this project's [composer.json file][composer-file],
   such as the [mongo php adapter][mongo-php] or the [monolog library][monolog], depending on
   the features required.

   ```bash
   # install required, default dependencies
   composer install

   # install any optional dependencies, if required
   composer require namespace/package
   ```

   *Note: For instructions on installing [Composer][composer], reference their
   official [download instructions][composer-dl].*

3. __Work/Stage/Commit (Repeat):__ 
   Make the code changes required to fix your bug or implement your new feature, then stage
   your files with `git add` and commit your work with `git commit`. Your commit messages
   should summarize the changes such that others can gain a general understanding of both
   your literal changes and general intentions.

   ```bash
   # stage your changed files or directories
   git add foo/bar/file-a.ext

   # commit your changes with a short descriptive message
   git commit -m 'changed a, b, and c to implement d'
   ```

   *Note: It is highly recommended that you create frequent, small commits instead of large,
   unorganized ones. While smaller commits are easier to review and track for the project,
   they also allow you to easily revert local work if your progress detours down unproductive
   path.*

4. __Add/Edit Unit Tests:__ 
   You *must* add tests, as appropriate for the changes and/or additions you've made to the
   project. This project's test suite uses [PHPUnit][php-unit] and the unit tests can be
   found in the `Tests/` directory.

   ```bash
   # run the test suite by calling simple-phpunit
   vendor/bin/simple-phpunit
   ```

5. __Add/Edit Documentation:__ 
   All user-facing changes must be properly reflected in our documentation, whether your
   changes amend or add functionality. Documentation is formatted with
   [reStructuredText (RST)][rst-info] and can be found in the `Resources/doc/` directory.
   These [RST][rst-info] files are automatically compiled to generate our
   [official documentation website][docs].

   *Note: To test your local documentation changes, reference the
   [Building RST Documentation][rst-make] wiki page where you will find detailed
   information on compiling the documentation on your local environment.*

6. __Apply Code Style Standards:__ 
   You *must* ensure your changes abide by our code style standards before submitting any
   changes. To facilitate this, we define a [code style configuration file][cs-conf] for
   [php-cs-fixer][cs] that enabled you to apply our require code style in an automated
   manner.

    ```bash
    # call php-cs-fixer with "--dry-run" option to view changes without applying them
    vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix -vvv --diff --dry-run

    # to apply the code style changes, run without the "--dry-run" option
    vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix -vvv --diff

    # commit any changes made by the tool
    git commit -a -m 'php-cs-fixer run'
    ```

    *Note: Our [automated GitHub Actions builds][gh-actions] will mark a [pull request][pr-make] failed if
    it does not meet the required code style standards.*

7. __Push to Fork/Merge Upstream:__
   Having completed your local changes, added tests and documentation, and ensured code
   style standards are met, push your local changes back to your personal [GitHub][gh] fork
   of the repository.

   ```bash
   # push your local changes to your remote fork
   git push master -u origin
   ```

   Once you've pushed your changes to your fork, use the [GitHub][gh] web interface to
   [submit a pull request][gh-help-pr].
