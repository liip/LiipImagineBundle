General Filters
===============

.. _filter-background:

Background
----------

The built-in ``background`` filter performs layer transformations
(which includes creating and mergin layer operations). This
filter exposes a number of `background options`_ which may be used
to configure its behavior.

Example configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml

    liip_imagine:
        filter_sets:

            # name our filter set "my_background_filter"
            my_background_filter:
                filters:

                    # use and setup the "background" filter
                    background:

                        # set the background color to #00ffff
                        color: '#00ffff'

                        # set a size different from the input image
                        size: [1026, 684]

                        # center input image on the newly created background
                        position: center


.. note::

    The background color is only visible through transparent image sections (if
    any), unless a **size** option is provided, in which case a new image is
    created and the input image is placed on top according to the **position** option.


Background Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:strong:`color:` ``string``
    Sets the background color HEX value. The default color is white (``#fff``).

:strong:`size:` ``int[]``
    Sets the generated background size as an integer array containing the dimensions
    as width and height values.

:strong:`position:` ``string``
    Sets the position of the input image on the newly created background image. Valid
    values: ``topleft``, ``top``, ``topright``, ``left``, ``center``, ``right``, ``bottomleft``,
    ``bottom``, and ``bottomright``.

:strong:`transparency:` ``integer``
    Sets the background alpha value. The value should be within a range of 0 - 100.


.. _filter-grayscale:

Grayscale
---------

The built-in ``grayscale`` filter performs color transformations
(which includes gray value calculations). This
filter does not expose any options which may be used
to configure its behavior.

Example configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml

    liip_imagine:
        filter_sets:

            # name our filter set "my_grayscale_filter"
            my_grayscale_filter:
                filters:

                    # use and setup the "grayscale" filter
                    grayscale: ~


.. _filter-interlace:

Interlace
---------

The built-in ``interlace`` filter performs file transformations
(which includes modifying the encoding method). This
filter exposes a number of `interlace options`_ which may be used
to configure its behavior.

Example configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml

    liip_imagine:
        filter_sets:

            # name our filter set "my_interlace_filter"
            my_interlace_filter:
                filters:

                    # use and setup the "interlace" filter
                    interlace:

                        # set the interlace mode to line
                        mode: line


Interlace Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:strong:`mode:` ``string``
    Sets the interlace mode to encode the file with. Valid values: ``none``, ``line``,
    ``plane``, and ``partition``.


.. _filter-strip:

Strip
-----


The built-in ``strip`` filter performs file transformations
(which includes metadata removal). This
filter does not exposes any options which may be used
to configure its behavior.

Example configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml

    liip_imagine:
        filter_sets:

            # name our filter set "my_strip_filter"
            my_strip_filter:
                filters:

                    # use and setup the "strip" filter
                    strip: ~


.. _filter-watermark:

Watermark
---------

The built-in ``watermark_image`` filter adds a watermark to an existing image
(which includes creating and merging image operations). This
filter exposes a number of `watermark options`_ which may be used
to configure its behavior.

Example configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml

    liip_imagine:
        filter_sets:

            # name our filter set "my_watermark_filter"
            my_watermark_filter:
                filters:

                    # use and setup the "watermark_image" filter
                    watermark_image:

                        # path to the watermark file (prepended with "%kernel.project_dir%")
                        image: assets/watermark.png

                        # size of the water mark relative to the input image
                        size: 0.5

                        # set the position of the watermark
                        position: center


Watermark Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:strong:`image:` ``string``
    Sets the location of the watermark image. The value of this option is prepended
    with the resolved value of the ``%kernel.project_dir%`` parameter.

:strong:`size:` ``float``
    Sets the size of the watermark as a relative ration, relative to the original
    input image.

:strong:`position:` ``string``
    Sets the position of the watermark on the input image. Valid values: ``topleft``,
    ``top``, ``topright``, ``left``, ``center``, ``right``, ``bottomleft``, ``bottom``,
    ``bottomright`` and ``multiple``.

    When using ``multiple``, the watermark is pasted onto the image as often as possible.

.. caution::

    The **position** option and **ordering** for this filter is significant.
    For example, calling a ``crop`` after this filter could unintentionally
    remove the watermark entirely from the final image.
