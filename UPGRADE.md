# Upgrade

## 1.7.x

  - __[Data Loader]__ The `FileSystemLoader` data loader performs a more robust security check against image resource
    paths to ensure they reside within the defined data root path(s). If utilizing symbolic links, you should reference
    the troubleshooting guide at the end of this upgrade notice.

  - __[Data Loader]__ The `FileSystemLoader` data loader now accepts an array of paths (as strings) for its third
    constructor argument, enabling the loader to check multiple paths for the requested image resource.

  - __[Configuration]__ The `liip_imagine.loaders.default.filesystem.data_root` bundle configuration option now accepts
    an array of paths (as strings) or a single scalar path ()if only one is required for your configuration), allowing
    the `filesystem` data loader to check multiple data root paths for the requested image resource. The following YML
    configuration shows examples for all allowed value types.

    ```yml

      # provide an array of scalar paths
      liip_imagine:
        loaders:
          default:
            filesystem:
              data_root:
                - /multiple/root/paths/foo
                - /multiple/root/paths/bar

      # provide an single scalar path
      liip_imagine:
        loaders:
          default:
            filesystem:
              data_root: /single/root/path

    ```
  
  - __[Troubleshooting]__ If you are using the `filesystem` data loader and have *symbolic links* within the `data_root`
    that point outside this path (the `data_root` option defaults to `%kernel.root_dir%/../web`) then you are *required*
    to configure all outside resource paths as additional `data_root` paths using the following option key in your
    application's configuration: `liip_imagine.loaders.default.filesystem.data_root`.
    
    The following is a list of the most common exception error messages encountered when the `data_root` option is not
    correctly configured:

    - > Source image not resolvable "%s" in root path(s) "%s"
    - > Source image invalid "%s" as it is outside of the defined root path(s) "%s"

## 1.0.0-alpha7

    `liip_imagine.controller` config

        -liip_imagine:
        -    controller_action: AcmeDemoBundle:Default:filterAction
