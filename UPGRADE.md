# Upgrade

## 1.8.1

 - __[Data Loader]__ The arguments for the `FileSystemLoader` class constructor have changed. Instead of passing data
 roots as third parameter and optionally a `LocatorInterace` as fourth parameter, a `LocatorInterface`
 should now be passed as third parameter. The data roots no longer need to be passed to the `FileSystemLoader` class
 constructor but need to be passed to `LocatorInterface` class constructor instead.
 Passing data roots as a third parameter to the `FileSystemLoader` class constructor is still allowed, but deprecated
 and will be removed in `2.0`.
 Passing both data roots as well as a `LocatorInterface` instance to the `FileSystemLoader` class constructor is still
 supported but deprecated and will be removed in `2.0` as well. Note that when you this, any data root that was already
 set in the `LocatorInteface` will be overwritten by de data roots passed to the `FileSystemLoader`.
 
## 1.8.0

 - __[Routing]__ The `Resources/config/routing.xml` file has been deprecated and will be removed in `2.0`. Use the new
 YAML variant moving forward `Resources/config/routing.yaml`.

## 1.7.3

  - __[Data Loader]__ The `FileSystemLoader` now allows you to assign keys to data roots, and directly reference them when
  requesting resources.

    ```yml

      # provide index for data roots
      liip_imagine:
        loaders:
          default:
            filesystem:
              data_root:
                foo: /path/to/foo
                bar: /path/to/bar

    ```

    Assume you have a file name `file.ext` in both data root paths. Given the above configuration, you can specifically
    request the file from the `/path/to/foo` root using the following file syntax: `@foo:file.ext`. Similarly, you can
    request the same file from `/path/to/bar` using `@bar:file.ext`. Note, that the auto-registered bundles (detailed below)
    are given indexes of their short bundle name (for example, given the bundle `FooBundle`, you can request a file from
    its public resources path via `@FooBundle:path/to/file.ext`).

  - __[Data Loader]__ The `FileSystemLoader` now supports automatically registering the `Resources/public` folders within
  all loaded bundles. This can be enabled via the following configuration.

    ```yml

      # enable bundle auto-registration
      liip_imagine:
        loaders:
          default:
            filesystem:
              bundle_resources:
                enabled: true

    ```

    Additionally, you can whitelist or blacklist specific bundles from the auto-registration routine.

    ```yml

      # blacklist "FooBundle" from auto-registration
      liip_imagine:
        loaders:
          default:
            filesystem:
              bundle_resources:
                enabled: true
                access_control_type: blacklist
                access_control_list
                  - FooBundle

      # whitelist "BarBundle" from auto-registration
      liip_imagine:
        loaders:
          default:
            filesystem:
              bundle_resources:
                enabled: true
                access_control_type: whitelist
                access_control_list
                  - BarBundle

    ```

  - __[Data Locator]__ The `*Locator` services passed to `FileSystemLoader` are now marked as "non-shared" or "prototype"
  within the DI container, resulting in new instances being passed every time the services are requested.

## 1.7.2

  - __[Data Loader]__ The `FileSystemLoader`'s resource locator has been abstracted out into `FileSystemLocator`
  (provides the same `realpath`-based locator algorithm introduced in the `1.7.0` release) and `FileSystemInsecureLocator`
  (provides the old locator algorithm from version `1.6.x` and prior).

    The latter implementation can present security concerns, as it will blindly following symbolic links, including those
  that point outside your configured `data_root` directory(ies). It is *not recommended* unless your deployment process
  relies heavily on multi-level symbolic links that renders the new locator difficult (and sometime impossible) to
setup.

  - __[Deprecation]__ __[Data Loader]__ Instantiating `FileSystemLoader` without providing a forth constructor argument
  of signature `\Liip\ImagineBundle\Binary\Locator\LocatorInterface $locator` is deprecated and the ability to do so
  will be removed in the next major release, `2.0`.

  - __[Configuration]__ The `liip_imagine.loaders.default.filesystem.locator` bundle configuration option has been
  introduced and allows the following `enum` values: `filesystem` and `filesystem_insecure`. These correspond to the
  aforementioned `FileSystemLocator` and `FileSystemInsecureLocator` resource locator implementations that affect the
  behavior of `FileSystemLoader`. This option defaults to `filesystem`.

    ```yml

      # use the current, default locator algorithm
      liip_imagine:
        loaders:
          default:
            filesystem:
              locator: filesystem

      # use the old (pre 0.7.x) locator algorithm
      liip_imagine:
        loaders:
          default:
            filesystem:
              locator: filesystem_insecure

    ```

  - __[Dependency Injection]__ All compiler passes (filters, post-processors, data loaders, cache resolvers, etc) have
  been updated to log their behavior, allowing you to easily debug tagged services, including both core-provided and
  custom services defined by your application). In Symfony `>= 3.2` this output is located in the 
  `var/cache/[dev|prod|env]/app*ProjectContainerCompiler.log` file. Output will be similar to the following example on
  a fresh install.

    ```

      LoadersCompilerPass: Registered imagine-bimdle binary loader: liip_imagine.binary.loader.default
      FiltersCompilerPass: Registered imagine-bimdle filter loader: liip_imagine.filter.loader.relative_resize

    ```

## 1.7.1

  - __[Data Loader]__ The `FileSystemLoader` data loader performs a more robust security check against image resource
    paths to ensure they reside within the defined data root path(s). If utilizing symbolic links, you should reference
    the troubleshooting guide at the end of this upgrade notice.

  - __[Data Loader]__ The `FileSystemLoader` data loader now accepts an array of paths (as strings) for its third
    constructor argument, enabling the loader to check multiple paths for the requested image resource.
    *Note: this change breaks those extending this class and relying on the protected property `$dataRoot`, which has
    been renamed to `$dataRoots` and is now of the type `string[]` instead of the prior type of `string`.*

  - __[Configuration]__ The `liip_imagine.loaders.default.filesystem.data_root` bundle configuration option now accepts
    an array of paths (as strings) or a single scalar path ()if only one is required for your configuration), allowing
    the `filesystem` data loader to check multiple data root paths for the requested image resource. The following YML
    configuration shows examples for all allowed value types.

    ```yml

      # provide an array of scalar paths
      liip_imagine:
        loaders:
          default:
            filesystem:
              data_root:
                - /multiple/root/paths/foo
                - /multiple/root/paths/bar

      # provide an single scalar path
      liip_imagine:
        loaders:
          default:
            filesystem:
              data_root: /single/root/path

    ```
  
  - __[Troubleshooting]__ If you are using the `filesystem` data loader and have *symbolic links* within the `data_root`
    that point outside this path (the `data_root` option defaults to `%kernel.root_dir%/../web`) then you are *required*
    to configure all outside resource paths as additional `data_root` paths using the following option key in your
    application's configuration: `liip_imagine.loaders.default.filesystem.data_root`.
    
    The following is a list of the most common exception error messages encountered when the `data_root` option is not
    correctly configured:

    - > Source image not resolvable "%s" in root path(s) "%s"
    - > Source image invalid "%s" as it is outside of the defined root path(s) "%s"

## 1.0.0-alpha7

    `liip_imagine.controller` config

      ```diff
